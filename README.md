# PEA-project
## Project description 
This is a project I made at the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), I worked on a project to automate data extraction and analysis. Using the Beautiful Soup (bs4) and Selenium libraries, I scraped data from the 'Report50' section of the PEA website, which logs monthly instances of false electrical data in households.

## This repo contains 
1. juneupdate.xlsx - false electrical data in june 
3. report50_y2022m_7.xlsx - false electrical data in july
4. updateserver.py - update data in mysql server 
5. webscrap_manual.py - code for web scraping report50
6. webscrap_monthly.py - ode for web scraping report50 and creating a dashboard automatically every month
